      I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on
      new lines below me.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as
      tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content +
      padding + border width/height.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
      separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
