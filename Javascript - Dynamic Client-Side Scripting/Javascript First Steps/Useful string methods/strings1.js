// In our first strings task, we start off small. You already have half of a famous quote inside a variable called quoteStart; we would like you to:

// Look up the other half of the quote, and add it to the example inside a variable called quoteEnd.
// Concatenate the two strings together to make a single string containing the complete quote. Save the result inside a variable called finalQuote.
